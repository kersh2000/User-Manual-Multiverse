						<strong id="styles">My Styles:</strong>
						<li>I work very well independently for long periods of time, once I get into the swing of things and fully understand what I am working on.</li>
						<li>I like to break large problems down into smaller chunks, which allows me to easily create a clear, organised, and structured plan for a task.</li>
						<li>I enjoy teaching people new concepts or ideas which they are either struggling to understand or want or learn more about.</li>
					</ul>	
					<ul class="rightBullet", id="ulValues">
						<strong id="values">What I value:</strong>
						<li>People who are open-minded and not afraid to change or accept new ideas.</li>
						<li>Those who are patient and understand that everyone is human, and we all make mistakes.</li>
						<li>Not being afraid to give criticism. Receiving criticism is a great way for people to self-reflect and learn from their mistakes but giving criticism in a generous way is equally important in order to efficiently work in a team!</li>
					</ul>	
				
					<ul class="leftBullet", id="ulPatience">
						<strong id="patience">What I don't have patience for:</strong>
						<li>A lack of acknowledgement and recognition! I highly value people who will have the patience to listen to everyone's ideas or fully respond to everyone's concerns before moving on or being ignored</li>
						<li>People who avoid taking the blame / being accountable when they have made an error. A problem cannot often be solved unless the root cause is first identified, because everyone makes mistakes, which is a truth that we should not frown upon.</li>
					</ul>	
				
					<ul class="rightBullet", id="ulCommunication">
						<strong id="communication">How to best communicate with me:</strong>
						<li>Emails and Teams are a standard for me, but for a more informal chat or request, WhatsApp is preferred. Video calls and in-person meetings are also another viable option.</li>
					</ul>	
				
				
					<ul class="leftBullet", id="ulHelp">
						<strong id="help">How to help me:</strong>
						<li>Asking me if I need help; I often enjoy working independently and will try my best to solve an issue on my own before asking for assistance.</li>
						<li>If there is a large problem that needs solving, which I do not understand, breaking the problem down into smaller steps is often the best way for me to fully understand the context of that problem, in order to begin problem-solving.</li>
						<li>Explaining the reason or root cause behind a problem, which will give me even more motivation and drive to solving the obstacle, i.e., seeing the big-picture.</li>
					</ul>	
				
					<ul class="rightBullet", id="ulMisunderstood">
						<strong id="misunderstood">What people misunderstand about me:</strong>
						<li>Being misunderstood as unapproachable, as I am often become silent and highly focused when problem-solving / completing a task. Meanwhile, I am more than happy to talk when needed!</li>
					</ul>	
				
					<ul class="leftBullet", id="ulPersonality">
						<strong id="personality">16 Personalities Type:</strong>
						<li>INFJ-A (Advocate)</li>
